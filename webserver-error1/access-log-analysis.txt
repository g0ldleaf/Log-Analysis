We noticed that the GET requsts start receiving 404 errors at one point.
We asked some questions to follow up:

Alex Rivie 5:09 PM
Hi Frank, does /Minimal-Text/css/style.css still exist on the server
Frank Rose 5:09 PM
nope
Sarah Gold 5:14 PM
Did somebody purposefully delete the style sheet around 11:45pm on 8/25?
Frank Rose 5:15 PM
A new build was deployed around that time
Alex Rivie 5:17 PM
Is there a reason why pages are still referencing that file? We are getting 404 errors for /Minimal-Text/css/style.css
Sarah Gold 5:21 PM
Did somebody from our design team deploy it as a planned update?
Frank Rose 5:23 PM
It was deployed as planned. Looks like someone on the dev team made a mistake.
Sarah Gold 5:24 PM
Silly programmer

In conclusion, the web dev department didn't update the code to point at the new css file.
